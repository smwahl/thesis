The inherent difficulty of making and interpreting measurements of the deep interior
of the Earth and other planets necessitates the construction of models for their
structure and evolution.  Properties of materials at actual planetary conditions are
a key input to these models. For the Earth these conditions extend to the hundreds of
GPa and thousands of Kelvin; for the energetic impact events and within the gas
giants the range is extended to several TPa and perhaps tens of thousands Kelvin.
Despite tremendous advances in experimental techniques, computer simulations of
materials play an important role in characterizing materials within planetary
interiors.

This thesis presents a variety of work using computational techniques to: 1)
determine properties of planetary materials from first-principles physics
simulations, and 2) apply of these derived properties to models of large-scale
planetary structure and processes. First principles calculations are unique in their
ability to simulate a nearly unbounded range of pressure-temperature conditions,
including those beyond the capacity of any experimental techniques. 

In this thesis, I discuss the physics and numerical techniques I have used and
developed to simulate planetary materials at high temperatures, and to interpret and
condense the results of these calculations. I then then look at studies applying the
first principles techniques to specific problems in planetary science. I test the
stability of a compact rocky cores in the metallic hydrogen-helium envelopes of gas
giants, finding that such cores are likely to undergo dissolution and erosion. I then
explore the miscibility of terrestrial cores and mantles at extreme temperatures,
like those expected in catastrophic giant impacts, which are now thought to be
commonplace in the early history of the terrestrial planets, or deep inside
``super-Earth'' exoplanets. 

I continue by detailing studies applying material equations of State from simulation
and experiment. I describe work towards developing a more comprehensive
thermo-chemical model of liquid iron alloys integrated with models of Mercuryâ€™s
thermal history and magnetic field energetics. I then describe the derivation and
implementation of a new numerical, non-perturbative method for precise calculations
of gravitational field strength for a rotating, liquid planet with tides. I then look
at the consequences of this new method for the tidal responses of Jupiter and Saturn.
Finally I detail my work on an ongoing effort using interior structure models of
Jupiter to interpret the drastically improved measurements of Jupiter's gravity by
the \textit{Juno} spacecraft mission.
