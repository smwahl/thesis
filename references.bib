These include heat capacity, enthalpy, enthalpies of transition and melting, vapor pressure, and enthalpy of vaporization. The recommended values for heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy function cover the temperature range from 1 to 3200 K for iron and 1 to 3600 K for silicon. The recommended values for vapor pressure cover the temperature range from 298.15 to 3200 K for iron and from 298.15 to 3600 K for silicon. These values are referred to temperatures based on the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968. The energy units used are joules per mol (J mol−1). The uncertainties in the recommended values of the heat capacity range from ±1.5% to ±5%.},

abstract = {An equation of state is presented for liquid iron based on published ultrasonic, thermal expansion, and enthalpy data at 1 bar and on pulse-heating and shock wave compression and sound speed data up to 10 Mbar. The equation of state parameters, centered at 1 bar and 1811 K (the normal melting point of iron), are density, $\rho$0 = 7019 kg/m3, isentropic bulk modulus, KS0 = 109.7 GPa, and the first-and second-pressure derivatives of KS, K′S0 = 4.66 and K″S0 = −0.043 GPa−1. A parameterization of the Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter $\gamma$ as a function of density $\rho$ and specific internal energy E is $\gamma$ = $\gamma$0 + $\gamma$′($\rho$/$\rho$0)n(E - E0) where $\gamma$0 = 1.735, $\gamma$′ = −0.130 kg/MJ, n = −1.87, and E0 is the internal energy of the liquid at 1 bar and 1811 K. The model gives the temperature dependence of $\gamma$ at constant volume as (∂$\gamma$/∂T)v|1bar,1811K = −8.4 × 10−5 K−1. The constant volume specific heat of liquid Fe at core conditions is 4.0–4.5 R. The model gives excellent agreement with measured temperatures of Fe under shock compression. Comparison with a preliminary reference Earth model indicates that the light component of the core does not significantly affect the magnitude of the isentropic bulk modulus of liquid Fe but does decrease its pressure derivative by ∼10%. Pure liquid Fe is 3–6% more dense than the inner core, supporting the presence of several percent of light elements in the inner core.},

abstract = {In-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments using a multi-anvil apparatus have been conducted on face-centered cubic iron (??-Fe), which is a possible component of metallic cores in planetary bodies. From the pressure-volume-temperature (P-V-T) data collected systematically at 0-24GPa and 873-1873K, we have constructed the thermal equation of state (EoS) of ??-Fe. A fit with a high-temperature Birch-Murnaghan (HT-BM) EoS yields the unit-cell volume V0, 1273K=49.026(25)??3, isothermal bulk modulus K1273K=110.8(18)GPa, pressure derivative of the bulk modulus K'=5.3(2), temperature derivative of the bulk modulus (???KT/???T)P=-0.0288(17)GPaK-1 and thermal expansion coefficient ??=4.50(36)??10-5+1.81(30)??10-8T(K)K-1, respectively, at 0GPa and 1273K. A fit of the Mie-Gr??neisen-Debye BM-EoS yields V0, 1273K=49.026(25)??3, K1273K=111.5(18)GPa, K'=5.2(2), the Gr??neisen parameter ??0=2.28(4), and a dimensionless parameter q=-0.21(22), with the fixed Debye temperature ??0=340K. From the present P-V-T data, the spin transformation from mixed- or intermediate-spin to low-spin states is considered to occur with increasing pressure. The successive transition may be subtle, however and its effect on the compression behavior of ??-Fe is relatively small. The newly determined EoS of ??-Fe enables us to more precisely estimate the density of the metallic cores of Mercury, Mars and planetary satellites such as the Moon and Ganymede. The estimated densities of cores in those planetary bodies depend strongly on adapted temperatures in the range of those previously proposed. The metallic cores of those planets as well as that of Earth might contain some other elements such as Ni, S, C, Si, O, and H. The core densities determined in this study provide a reference point to discuss the thermal and compositional structures in planetary and satellite cores when their core densities are determined by future surveys. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Using the Birch Murnaghan finite strain approach to fit pressure-dependent adiabatic bulk and shear moduli, we extrapolated our velocities to inner Earth core densities and found that our shear wave speeds are 3% higher than those in previous studies. Our results on pure iron provide a more accurate and precise baseline to which added complications (e.g., Ni concentration, inclusion of various light elements, and temperature effects) can be considered when comparing experimental elasticity measurements to inner core seismic data},

abstract = {We use new interior models of cold planets to investigate the mass-radius relationships of solid exoplanets, considering planets made primarily of iron, silicates, water, and carbon compounds. We find that the mass-radius relationships for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic functional form that is not a simple power law: log10Rs=k1+1/3log10(Ms)-k2Mk3s for up to Mp$\sim$20 M⊕, where Ms and Rs are scaled mass and radius values. This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form $\rho$=$\rho$0+cPn. We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5% fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with $\sim$5% uncertainty water ice planets with >$\sim$25% water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state. We propose a definition of ``super-Earths'' based on the clear distinction in radii between planets with significant gas envelopes and those without.},

abstract = {Earth-based radar observation of Mercury's rotation vector combined with gravity observation by the MESSENGER spacecraft yield a measure of Mercury's moment of inertia and the amplitude of the 88-day libration of its silicate shell. These two geodetic constraints provide information on Mercury's interior structure, including the presence of a fluid core, the radius of the core-mantle boundary and the bulk densities of the core and mantle. In this work, we show how they further provide information on the size of the solid inner core and on the crystallization regime of the fluid core. If Mercury's fluid core is a Fe-FeS alloy with a sulfur concentration on the Fe-rich side of the eutectic, the largest inner core compatible with geodetic observations at the 1. $\sigma$ level is 1325. ±. 250. km. Our results further suggest that the crystallization scenario that best fits the geodetic observations involves the formation of Fe-snow within the fluid core, and that this scenario is preferred for models with an iron-poor mantle composition. Consequently, Mercury's dynamo most likely operates in concert with snow formation. For an inner core larger than $\sim$650. km, snow formation extends to the inner core boundary. If a dynamo cannot be maintained by the dynamics of snow formation, or if such dynamo produces a magnetic field incompatible with observation, Mercury's inner core must then be smaller than 650. km.},

abstract = {The 2004-discovery of the post-perovskite transition initiated a vigorous effort in high-pressure, high-temperature mineralogy and mineral physics, seismology and geodynamics aimed at an improved understanding of the structure and dynamics of the D ''-zone. The phase transitions in basaltic and peridotitic lithologies under pT-conditions of the lowermost mantle can explain a series of previously enigmatic seismic discontinuities. Some of the other seismic properties of the lowermost mantle are also consistent with the changes in physical properties related to the perovskite (pv) to post-perovskite (ppv) transition. After more than 25 years of seismic tomography, the lowermost mantle structure involving the sub-Pacific and sub-African Large Low Shear-Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) has become a robust feature. The two large antipodal LLSVPs are surrounded by wide zones of high Vs under the regions characterized by Mesozoic to recent subduction. The D '' is further characterized by a negative correlation between shear and bulk sound velocity which could be partly related to an uneven distribution of pv and ppv. Ppv has higher VS and lower V-Phi (bulk sound speed) than pv and may be present in thicker layers in the colder regions of D ''. Seismic observations and geodynamic modelling indicate relatively steep and sharp boundaries of the 200-500 km thick LLSVPs. These features, as well as independent evidence for their long-term stability, indicate that they are intrinsically denser than the surrounding mantle. Mineral physics data demonstrate that basaltic lithologies are denser than peridotite throughout the lowermost mantle and undergo incremental densification due to the pvppv-transition at slightly shallower levels than peridotite. The density contrasts may facilitate the partial separation and accumulation of basaltic patches and slivers at the margins of the thermochemical piles (LLSVPs). The slopes of these relatively steep margins towards the adjacent horizontal core-mantle boundary (CMB) constitute a curved (concave) thermal boundary layer, favourable for the episodic generation of large mantle plumes. Reconstruction of the original positions of large igneous provinces formed during the last 300 Ma, using a paleomagnetic global reference frame, indicates that nearly all of them erupted above the margins of the LLSVPs. Fe/Mg-partitioning between pv, ppv and ferropericlase (fp) is important for the phase and density relations of the lower mantle. Electronic spin transition of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the different phases may influence the Fe/Mg-partitioning and the radiative thermal conductivity in the lowermost mantle. The experimental determination of the K-Dpv/fp(Fe/Mg) [= (Fc/Mg)(pv)/(Fc/Mg)(fp)] K-Dppv/fp(Fe/ Mg) is technologically challenging. Most studies have found a K-Dpv/fp(Fe/ Mg) of 0.1-0.3 and a higher Fe/Mg-ratio in ppv than in pv. The experimental temperature is important, with the partitioning approaching unity with increasing temperature. Although charge-coupled substitutions of the trivalent cations Al and Fe3+ seem to be important in both pv and ppv (especially in basaltic compositions), the complicating crystal-chemistry effects of these cations are not fully clarified. The two anti-podal thermochemical piles as well as the thin ultra-low velocity zones next to the CMB may represent geochemically enriched reservoirs that have remained largely isolated from the convecting mantle through a major part of Earth history. The eistence of such " hidden" reservoirs have previously been suggested in order to account for the imbalance between the inferred composition of the geochemically accessible convecting mantle and the observed heat flow from the Earth and chondritic models for the bulk Earth.},

abstract = {Compositional models of the Earth are critically dependent on three main sources of information: the seismic profile of the Earth and its interpretation, comparisons between primitive meteorites and the solar nebula composition, and chemical and petrological models of peridotite-basalt melting relationships. Whereas a family of compositional models for the Earth are permissible based on these methods, the model that is most consistent with the seismological and geodynamic structure of the Earth comprises an upper and lower mantle of similar composition, an FeNi core having between 5% and 15% of a low-atomic-weight element, and a mantle which, when compared to CI carbonaceous chondrites, is depleted in Mg and Si relative to the refractory lithophile elements. The absolute and relative abundances of the refractory elements in carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondritic meteorites are compared. The bulk composition of an average CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and from the refractory element compositions of different groups of chondrites. The absolute uncertainties in their refractory element compositions are evaluated by comparing ratios of these elements. These data are then used to evaluate existing models of the composition of the Silicate Earth. The systematic behavior of major and trace elements during differentiation of the mantle is used to constrain the Silicate Earth composition. Seemingly fertile peridotites have experienced a previous melting event that must be accounted for when developing these models. The approach taken here avoids unnecessary assumptions inherent in several existing models, and results in an internally consistent Silicate Earth composition having chondritic proportions of the refractory lithophile elements at ??? 2.75 times that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Element ratios in peridotites, komatiites, basalts and various crustal rocks are used to assess the abundances of both non-lithophile and non-refractory elements in the Silicate Earth. These data provide insights into the accretion processes of the Earth, the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle, the effect of core formation, and indicate negligible exchange between the core and mantle throughout the geologic record (the last 3.5 Ga). The composition of the Earth's core is poorly constrained beyond its major constituents (i.e. an FeNi alloy). Density contrasts between the inner and outer core boundary are used to suggest the presence (??? 10 ?? 5%) of a light element or a combination of elements (e.g., O, S, Si) in the outer core. The core is the dominant repository of siderophile elements in the Earth. The limits of our understanding of the core's composition (including the light-element component) depend on models of core formation and the class of chondritic meteorites we have chosen when constructing models of the bulk Earth's composition. The Earth has a bulk Fe Al of ??? 20 ?? 2, established by assuming that the Earth's budget of Al is stored entirely within the Silicate Earth and Fe is partitioned between the Silicate Earth (??? 14%) and the core (??? 86%). Chondritic meteorites display a range of Fe Al ratios, with many having a value close to 20. A comparison of the bulk composition of the Earth and chondritic meteorites reveals both similarities and differences, with the Earth being more strongly depleted in the more volatile elements. There is no group of meteorites that has a bulk composition matching that of the Earth's. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Of the terrestrial planets, Earth and probably Mercury possess substantial intrinsic magnetic fields generated by core dynamos, while Venus and Mars apparently lack such fields. Thermal histories are calculated for these planets and are found to admit several possible present states, including those which suggest simple explanations for the observations; whule the cores of Earth and Mercury are continuing to freeze, the cores of Venus and Mars may still be completely liquid. The models assume whole mantle convection, which is parameterized by a simple Nusselt-Rayleigh number relation and dictates the rate at which heat escapes from the core. It is found that completely fluid cores, devoid of intrinsic heat sources, are not likely to sustain thermal convection for the age of the solar system but cool to a subadiabatic, conductive state that can not maintain a dynamo. Planets which nucleate an inner core continue to sustain a dynamo because of the gravitational energy release and chemically driven convection that accompany inner core growth. The absence of a significant inner core can arise in Venus because of its slightly higher temperature and lower central pressure relative to Earth, while a Martian core avoids the onset of freezing if the abundance of sulfur in the core is {greater-than or approximate}15% by mass. All of the models presented assume that (I) core dynamos are driven by thermal and/or chemical convection; (ii) radiogenic heat production is confined to the mantle; (iii) mantle and core cool from initially hot states which are at the solidus and superliquidus, respectively; and (iv) any inner core excludes the light alloying material (sulfur or oxygen) which then mixes uniformly upward through the outer core. The models include realistic pressure and composition-dependent freezing curves for the core, and material parameters are chosen so that the correct present-day values of heat outflow, upper mantle temperature and viscosity, and inner core radius are obtained for the earth. It is found that Venus and Mars may have once had dynamos maintained by thermal convection alone. Earth may have had a completely fluid core and a dynamo maintained by thermal convection for the first 2 to 3 by, but an inner core nucleates and the dynamo energetics are subsequently dominated by gravitational energy release. Complete freezing of the Mercurian core is prohibited if it contains even a small amount of sulfur, and a dynamo can be maintained by chemical convection in a thin, fluid shell. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchangecorrelation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density, It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

abstract = {The in situ measurements of the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer (GPMS) were expected to constrain the abundances of the cloud-forming condensible volatile gases: H2O, H2S, and NH3. However, since the probe entry site (PES) was an unusually dry meteorological system-a 5-$\mu$m hotspot-the measured condensible volatile abundances did not follow the canonical condensation-limited vertical profiles of equilibrium cloud condensation models (ECCMs) such as Weidenschilling and Lewis (1973, Icarus 20, 465-476). Instead, the mixing ratios of H2S and NH3 increased with depth, finally reaching well-mixed equilibration levels at pressures far greater than the lifting condensation levels, whereas the mixing ratio of H2O in the deep well-mixed atmosphere could not be measured. The deep NH3 mixing ratio (with respect to H2) of (6.64±2.54)×10-4 from 8.9-11.7 bar GPMS data is consistent with the NH3 profile from probe-to-orbiter signal attenuation (Folkner et al., 1998, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 22847-22856), which had an equilibration level of about 8 bar. The GPMS deep atmosphere H2S mixing ratio of (8.9±2.1)×10-5 is the only measurement of Jupiter's sulfur abundance, with a PES equilibration level somewhere between 12 and 15.5 bar. The deepest water mixing ratio measurement is (4.9±1.6) ×10-4 (corresponding to only about 30% of the solar abundance) at 17.6-20.9 bar, a value that is probably much smaller than Jupiter's bulk water abundance. The 15N/14N ratio in jovian NH3 was measured at (2.3±0.3) ×10-3 and may provide the best estimate of the protosolar nitrogen isotopic ratio. The GPMS methane mixing ratio is (2.37±0.57)×10-3; although methane does not condense on Jupiter, we include its updated analysis in this report because like the condensible volatiles, it was presumably brought to Jupiter in icy planetesimals. Our detailed discussion of calibration and error analysis supplements previously reported GPMS measurements of condensible volatile mixing ratios (Niemann et al., 1998, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 22831-22846; Atreya et al., 1999, Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1243-1262; Atreya et al., 2003, Planet. Space Sci. 51, 105-112) and the nitrogen isotopic ratio (Owen et al., 2001b, Astrophys. J. Lett. 553, L77-L79). The approximately three times solar abundance of NH3 (along with CH4 and H2S) is consistent with enrichment of Jupiter's atmosphere by icy planetesimals formed at temperatures <40 K (Owen et al., 1999, Nature 402 (6759), 269-270), but would imply that H2O should be at least 3×solar as well. An alternate model, using clathrate hydrates to deliver the nitrogen component to Jupiter, predicts O/H≥9×solar (Gautier et al., 2001, Astrophys. J. 550 (2), L227-L230). Finally we show that the measured condensible volatile vertical profiles in the PES are consistent with column-stretching or entraining downdraft scenarios only if the basic state (the pre-stretched column or the entrainment source region) is described by condensible volatile vertical profiles that are drier than those in the equilibrium cloud condensation models. This dryness is supported by numerous remote sensing results but seems to disagree with observations of widespread clouds on Jupiter at pressure levels predicted by equilibrium cloud condensation models for ammonia and H2S. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The giant gas planets have hot convective interiors, and therefore a common assumption is that these deep atmospheres are close to a barotropic state. Here we show using a new anelastic general circulation model that baroclinic vorticity contributions are not negligible, and drive the system away from an isentropic and therefore barotropic state. The motion is still aligned with the direction of the axis of rotation as in a barotropic rotating fluid, but the wind structure has a vertical shear with stronger winds in the atmosphere than in the interior. This shear is associated with baroclinic compressibility effects. Most previous convection models of giant planets have used the Boussinesq approximation, which assumes the density is constant in depth; however, Jupiter's actual density varies by four orders of magnitude through its deep molecular envelope. We therefore developed a new general circulation model (based on the MITgcm) that is anelastic and thereby incorporates this density variation. The model's geometry is a full 3D sphere down to a small inner core. It is nonhydrostatic, uses an equation of state suitable for hydrogen-helium mixtures (SCVH), and is driven by an internal heating profile. We demonstrate the effect of compressibility by comparing anelastic and Boussinesq cases. The simulations develop a mean state that is geostrophic and hydrostatic including the often neglected, but significant, vertical Coriolis contribution. This leads to modification of the standard thermal wind relation for a deep compressible atmosphere. The interior flow organizes in large cyclonically rotating columnar eddies parallel to the rotation axis, which drive upgradient angular momentum eddy fluxes, generating the observed equatorial superrotation. Heat fluxes align with the axis of rotation, and provide a mechanism for the transport of heat poleward, which can cause the observed flat meridional emission. We address the issue of over-forcing which is common in such convection models and analyze the dependence of our results on this; showing that the vertical wind structure is not very sensitive to the Rayleigh number. We also study the effect of rotation, showing how the transition from a rapidly to a slowly rotating system affects the dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The high-pressure response of cryogenic liquid deuterium (LD2) has been studied to pressures of ∼400GPa and densities of ∼1.5g/cm3. Using intense magnetic pressure produced by the Sandia National Laboratories Z accelerator, macroscopic aluminum or titanium flyer plates, several mm in lateral dimensions and a few hundred microns in thickness, have been launched to velocities in excess of 22 km/s, producing constant pressure drive times of approximately 30 ns in plate impact, shock wave experiments. This flyer plate technique was used to perform shock wave experiments on LD2 to examine its high-pressure equation of state. Using an impedance matching method, Hugoniot measurements of LD2 were obtained in the pressure range of ∼22–100GPa. Results of these experiments indicate a peak compression ratio of approximately 4.3 on the Hugoniot. In contrast, previously reported Hugoniot states inferred from laser-driven experiments indicate a peak compression ratio of approximately 5.5–6 in this same pressure range. The stiff Hugoniot response observed in the present impedance matching experiments was confirmed in simultaneous, independent measurements of the relative transit times of shock waves reverberating within the sample cell, between the front aluminum drive plate and the rear sapphire window. The relative timing was found to be sensitive to the density compression along the principal Hugoniot. Finally, mechanical reshock measurements of LD2 using sapphire, aluminum, and $\alpha$-quartz anvils were made. These results also indicate a stiff response, in agreement with the Hugoniot and reverberating wave measurements. Using simple model-independent arguments based on wave propagation, the principal Hugoniot, reverberating wave, and sapphire anvil reshock measurements are shown to be internally self-consistent, making a strong case for a Hugoniot response with a maximum compression ratio of ∼4.3–4.5. The trends observed in the present data are in very good agreement with several ab initio models and a recent chemical picture model for LD2, but in disagreement with previously reported laser-driven shock results. Due to this disagreement, significant emphasis is placed on the discussion of uncertainties, and the potential systematic errors associated with each measurement.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent spectroscopic observations suggesting that atmospheres of some extrasolar giant-planets are carbon-rich, i.e. carbon/oxygen ratio (C/O) $\ge$ 1, we find that the whole set of compositional data for Jupiter is consistent with the hypothesis that it be a carbon-rich giant planet. We show that the formation of Jupiter in the cold outer part of an oxygen-depleted disk (C/O $\sim$1) reproduces the measured Jovian elemental abundances at least as well as the hitherto canonical model of Jupiter formed in a disk of solar composition (C/O = 0.54). The resulting O abundance in Jupiter's envelope is then moderately enriched by a factor of $\sim$2 $\times$ solar (instead of $\sim$7 $\times$ solar) and is found to be consistent with values predicted by thermochemical models of the atmosphere. That Jupiter formed in a disk with C/O $\sim$1 implies that water ice was heterogeneously distributed over several AU beyond the snow line in the primordial nebula and that the fraction of water contained in icy planetesimals was a strong function of their formation location and time. The Jovian oxygen abundance to be measured by NASA's Juno mission en route to Jupiter will provide a direct and strict test of our predictions.},

abstract = {We compute, for the first time, self-consistent models of planet growth including the effect of envelope enrichment. The change of envelope metallicity is assumed to be the result of planetesimal disruption or icy pebble sublimation. We solve internal structure equations taking into account global energy conservation for the envelope to compute in-situ planetary growth. We consider different opacities and equations of state suited for a wide range of metallicities. We find that envelope enrichment speeds up the formation of gas giants. It also explains naturally the formation of low and intermediate mass objects with large fractions of H-He ($\sim$ 20 - 30 % in mass). High opacity models explain well the metallicity of the giant planets of the solar system, whereas low opacity models are suited for forming small mass objects with thick H-He envelopes and gas giants with sub-solar envelope metallicities. We find good agreement between our models and the estimated water abundance for WASP-43b. For HD 189733b, HD 209458b and WASP-12b we predict fractions of water larger than what is estimated from observations, by at least a factor $\sim$ 2. Envelope enrichment by icy planetesimals is the natural scenario to explain the formation of a large variety of objects, ranging from mini-Neptunes, to gas giants. We predict that the total and envelope metallicity decrease with planetary mass.},

These models rely heavily on experiments, analytical theory, and first-principles computer simulations of hydrogen and helium to understand their behavior up to the extreme pressures ∼10 Mbar and temperatures ∼10,000 K.We review the various equations of state used in Jupiter models and compare them with shock wave experiments.We discuss the possibility that helium rain, core erosion, and double diffusive convection have affected the structure and evolution of giant planets. In July 2016 the Juno spacecraft entered orbit around Jupiter, promising high-precision measurements of the gravitational field that will allow us to test our understanding of gas giant interiors better than ever before.},

Interior models are used to determine the amount of heavy elements in Jupiter interior, nevertheless this range is still subject to degeneracies due to uncertainties in the equations of state. Prior to Juno mission data arrival, we present Jupiter optimized calculations exploring the effect of different model parameters in the determination of Jupiter's core and heavy element's mass. We perform comparisons between equations of state published recently. The interior model of Jupiter is calculated from the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium, mass and energy conservation, and energy transport. The mass of the core and heavy elements is adjusted to match Jupiter's observational constrains radius and gravitational moments. We show that the determination of Jupiter interior structure is tied to the estimation of its gravitational moments and the accuracy of equations of state of hydrogen, helium and heavy elements. The location of the region where Helium rain occurs as well as its timescale are important to determine the distribution of heavy elements and helium in the interior of Jupiter. We show that differences find when modeling Jupiter's interior with recent EOS are more likely due to differences in the internal energy and entropy calculation. The consequent changes in the thermal profile lead to different estimations of the mass of the core and heavy elements, explaining differences in recently published Jupiter interior models. Our results help clarify differences find in Jupiter interior models and will help the interpretation of upcoming Juno data.},

The goal of the Juno mission is to explore the origin and evolution of the planet Jupiter. Juno{\rq}s science themes include (1) origin, (2) interior structure, (3) atmospheric composition and dynamics, and (4) polar magnetosphere and aurora. A total of nine instruments on-board provide speciﬁc measurements designed to investigate Juno{\rq}s science themes. The primary objective of investigating the origin of Jupiter includes 1) determine Jupiter{\rq}s internal mass distribution by measuring gravity with Doppler tracking, 2) determine the nature of its internal dynamo by measuring its magnetic ﬁelds with a magnetometer, and 3) determine the deep composition (in particular the global water abundance) and dynamics of the sub-cloud atmosphere around Jupiter, by measuring its thermal microwave emission.},

The meteoritic and solar abundances of a few elements (e.g., noble gases, beryllium, boron, phosphorous, sulfur) are discussed in detail. The photospheric abundances give mass fractions of hydrogen (X=0.7491), helium (Y=0.2377), and heavy elements (Z=0.0133), leading to Z/X=0.0177, which is lower than the widely used Z/X=0.0245 from previous compilations. Recent results from standard solar models considering helium and heavy-element settling imply that photospheric abundances and mass fractions are not equal to protosolar abundances (representative of solar system abundances). Protosolar elemental and isotopic abundances are derived from photospheric abundances by considering settling effects. Derived protosolar mass fractions are X0=0.7110, Y0=0.2741, and Z0=0.0149. The solar system and photospheric abundance tables are used to compute self-consistent sets of condensation temperatures for all elements.},

Good agreement between both techniques is found in an intermediate-temperature range. For the highest temperatures, the PIMC results converge to the Debye-H{{\"{u}}}ckel limiting law. In order to derive the entropy, a thermodynamically consistent free-energy fit is used that reproduces the internal energies and pressure derived from the first-principles simulations. The equation of state is presented in the form of a table as well as a fit and is compared with different free-energy models. Pair-correlation functions and the electronic density of states are discussed. Shock Hugoniot curves are compared with recent laser shock-wave experiments.},

Diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations predict that the band gap closes at a density of 21:3g=cm3 and a pressure of 25.7 terapascals, which is 20{\%} higher in density and 40{\%} higher in pressure than predicted by density functional calculations based on the generalized gradient approxi- mation (GGA). The metallization density derived from GW calculations is found to be in very close agreement with DMC predictions. The zero point motion of the nuclei had no effect on the metallization density within the accuracy of the calculation.

The main constituent of the core is iron, and therefore the melting temperature of iron at the pressure encountered at the boundary between the solid and the liquid (the ICB) provides an estimate of the temperature of the core. Here I report the melting temperature of Fe at pressures near that of the ICB, obtained with first principles techniques based on density functional theory. The calculations have been performed by directly simulating solid and liquid iron in coexistence, and show that and at a pressure of $\sim 328$ GPa iron melts at $\sim 6370\pm 100$ K. These findings are in good agreement with earlier simulations, which used exactly the same quantum mechanics techniques, but obtained melting properties from the calculation of the free energies of solid and liquid Fe},

abstract = {The effects of the equilibrium figure theory to within terms of the second order in a small parameter ?? on figure parameters and gravitational moments of the Galilean satellite Io have been considered. Integro-differential equations of the theory of figure to second order have been first solved numerically. Relations between the low-order coefficients of the gravitational field for satellites in hydrostatic equilibrium are generalized according to the second order theory. To show the effects of the second approximation, two three-layer trial models of Io are used. The considered models of the Io's interiors differ by the size and density of the core, while having the same thickness and density of the crust, and the mantle density difference is only 20 kg/m3. The corrections of second order in smallness to the gravitational moments J2 and C22 decrease the third decimal digit of model gravitational moments by two units. As the effects of third and forth harmonics are determined mostly by outer layers of Io, to distinguish between model mantle density, the gravitational moments J 4, C42 and C44 should be determined to accuracy with three or four decimal digits. The second order corrections mostly effect the semi-axis a, and less the semi-axes b and c. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Simulations of planets with fast rotation rates like those of Jupiter and Saturn, exhibit significant changes in calculated tidal love numbers $k_{nm}$ when compared with non-rotating bodies.

The calculated love number is robust under reasonable assumptions of interior rotation rate, satellite parameters, and details of Saturn's interior structure.

We assume helium rain modified the interior temperature and composition profiles. Our calculation predicts zonal harmonic values to which measurements can be compared. Although some models fit the observed (pre-Juno) second- and fourth-order zonal harmonics to within their error bars, our preferred reference model predicts a fourth-order zonal harmonic whose absolute value lies above the pre-Juno error bars.

We carry out this investigation with two general methods for solving for the interior structure of a differentially rotating planet: the CMS method of Hubbard (Hubbard, W.B. [2013]. Astrophys.

abstract = {The rotation rate of a planet is one of its fundamental properties. Saturn's rotation, however, is difficult to determine because there is no solid surface from which to time it, and the alternative 'clock'--the magnetic field--is nearly symmetrically aligned with the rotation axis. Radio emissions, thought to provide a proxy measure of the rotation of the magnetic field, have yielded estimates of the rotation period between 10 h 39 min 22 s and 10 h 45 min 45 s (refs 8-10). Because the period determined from radio measurements exhibits large time variations, even on timescales of months, it has been uncertain whether the radio-emission periodicity coincides with the inner rotation rate of the planet. Here we report magnetic field measurements that revealed a time-stationary magnetic signal with a period of 10 h 47 min 6 s +/- 40 s. The signal appears to be stable in period, amplitude and phase over 14 months of observations, pointing to a close connection with the conductive region inside the planet, although its interpretation as the 'true' inner rotation period is still uncertain.},

abstract = {We consider the Clairaut theory of the equilibrium ellipsoidal figures for differentiated non-homogeneous bodies in non-synchronous rotation adding to it a tidal deformation due to the presence of an external gravitational force. We assume that the body is a fluid formed by $n$ homogeneous layers of ellipsoidal shape and we calculate the external polar flattenings and the mean radius of each layer, or, equivalently, their semiaxes. To first order in the flattenings, the general solution can be written as $\epsilon_k={\cal H}_k*\epsilon_h$ and $\mu_k={\cal H}_k*\mu_h$, where $\cal{H}_k$ is a characteristic coefficient for each layer which only depends on the internal structure of the body and $\epsilon_h, \mu_h$ are the flattenings of the equivalent homogeneous problem. For the continuous case, we study the Clairaut differential equation for the flattening profile, using the Radau transformation to find the boundary conditions when the tidal potential is added. Finally, the theory is applied to several examples: i) a body composed of two homogeneous layers; ii) bodies with simple polynomial density distribution laws and iii) bodies following a polytropic pressure-density law.},

abstract = {The core mass of Saturn is commonly assumed to be 10-25 ME as predicted by interior models with various equations of state (EOSs) and the Voyager gravity data, and hence larger than that of Jupiter (0-10 ME). We here re-analyze Saturn's internal structure and evolution by using more recent gravity data from the Cassini mission and different physical equations of state: the ab initio LM-REOS which is rather soft in Saturn's outer regions but stiff at high pressures, the standard Sesame-EOS which shows the opposite behavior, and the commonly used SCvH-i EOS. For all three EOS we find similar core mass ranges, i.e. of 0-20 ME for SCvH-i and Sesame EOS and of 0-17 ME for LM-REOS. Assuming an atmospheric helium mass abundance of 18%, we find maximum atmospheric metallicities, Zatm of 7x solar for SCvH-i and Sesame-based models and a total mass of heavy elements, MZ of 25-30 ME. Some models are Jupiter-like. With LM-REOS, we find MZ=16-20 ME, less than for Jupiter, and Zatm less than 3x solar. For Saturn, we compute moment of inertia values lambda=0.2355(5). Furthermore, we confirm that homogeneous evolution leads to cooling times of only about 2.5 Gyr, independent on the applied EOS. Our results demonstrate the need for accurately measured atmospheric helium and oxygen abundances, and of the moment of inertia for a better understanding of Saturn's structure and evolution.},

@article{Helled2015,
abstract = {The alignment of Saturn's magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period1. The period was previously determined from radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft to be 10 h 39 min 22.4 s (ref. 2). When the Cassini spacecraft measured a period of 10 h 47 min 6 s, which was additionally found to change between sequential measurements3, 4, 5, it became clear that the radio period could not be used to determine the bulk planetary rotation period. Estimates based upon Saturn's measured wind fields have increased the uncertainty even more, giving numbers smaller than the Voyager rotation period, and at present Saturn's rotation period is thought to be between 10 h 32 min and 10 h 47 min, which is unsatisfactory for such a fundamental property. Here we report a period of 10 h 32 min 45 s ± 46 s, based upon an optimization approach using Saturn's measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles. Moreover, even when solely using the constraints from its gravitational field, the rotation period can be inferred with a precision of several minutes. To validate our method, we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known rotation period. Conventional methods of measuring the rotation periods of planets are either unusable or imprecise when applied to Saturn. Ravit Helled et al. have used a new approach to determine Saturn's rotation period — subjecting an estimate based on gravitational field measurements to an optimization procedure relating rotation period to various observed physical properties and their uncertainties. They validate the method by applying it to Jupiter, which has a tilted magnet field that can be exploited to measure rotation, and conclude that Saturn's rotation period is 10 h 32 min 45 s ± 46 s.},

abstract = {Any non-spherical distribution of density inside planets and stars gives rise to a non-spherical external gravity and change of shape. If part or all of the observed zonal flows at the cloud deck of giant planets represent deep interior dynamics, then the density perturbations associated with the deep zonal flows could generate gravitational signals detectable by the planned Juno mission and the Cassini Proximal Orbits. It is currently debated whether the thermal wind equation (TWE) can be used to calculate the gravity field associated with deep zonal flows. Here we present a critical comparison between the Euler equation and the thermal wind equation. Our analysis shows that the applicability of the TWE in calculating the gravity moments depends crucially on retaining the non-sphericity of the background density and gravity. Only when the background non-sphericity of the planet is taken into account, the TWE makes accurate enough prediction (with a few tens of percent errors) for the high-degree gravity moments associated with deep zonal flows. Since the TWE is derived from the curl of the Euler equation and is a local relation, it necessarily says nothing about any density perturbations that contribute irrotational terms to the Euler equation and that has a non-local origin. However, the predicted corrections from these density contributions to the low harmonic degree gravity moments are not discernible from insignificant changes in interior models while the corrections at high harmonic degree are very small, tens of percent or less.},

@article{Kramm2011,
abstract = {Context. In order to accurately model giant planets, a whole set of observational constraints is needed. As the conventional constraints for extrasolar planets like mass, radius, and temperature allow for a large number of acceptable models, a new planetary parameter is desirable in order to further constrain planetary models. Such a parameter may be the tidal Love number k2. Aims: In this paper we aim to study the capability of k2 to reveal further information about the interior structure of a planet. Methods: With theoretical planetary models we investigate how the tidal Love number k2 responds to the internal density distribution of a planet. In particular, we demonstrate the effect of the degeneracy of k2 due to a density discontinuity in the envelope of a three-layer planetary model. Results: The effect of a possible outer density discontinuity masks the effect of the core mass on the Love number k2. Hence, there is no unique relationship between the Love number k2 and the core mass of a planet. We show that the degeneracy of k2 with respect to a layer boundary in the envelope also occurs in existing planets, e.g. Saturn and the Hot Neptune GJ 436b. As a result of the degeneracy, the planetary parameter k2 cannot be used to further constrain the core mass of state-of-the-art Saturn models and for GJ 436b only a maximum possible core mass can be derived from a given k2. To significantly narrow the uncertainty about the core mass of GJ 436b the combined knowledge of k2 and atmospheric metallicity and temperature profile is necessary.},

abstract = {An accurate understanding of the phase diagram of dense hydrogen and helium mixtures is a crucial component in the construction of accurate models of Jupiter, Saturn, and Jovian extrasolar planets. Though DFT based first principles methods have the potential to provide the accuracy and computational efficiency required for this task, recent benchmarking in hydrogen has shown that achieving this accuracy requires a judicious choice of functional, and a quantification of the errors introduced. In this work, we present a quantum Monte Carlo based benchmarking study of a wide range of density functionals for use in hydrogen-helium mixtures at thermodynamic conditions relevant for Jovian planets. Not only do we continue our program of benchmarking energetics and pressures, but we deploy QMC based force estimators and use them to gain insights into how well the local liquid structure is captured by different density functionals. We find that TPSS, BLYP and vdW-DF are the most accurate functionals by most metrics, and that the enthalpy, energy, and pressure errors are very well behaved as a function of helium concentration. Beyond this, we highlight and analyze the major error trends and relative differences exhibited by the major classes of functionals, and estimate the magnitudes of these effects when possible.},
annote = {benchmark a range of density functionals in thermodynamic regimes relevant for helium sedimentation in Jovian planets.

Global energetics:
Though PBE has better than
average performance in this regime, one can gain a decent fraction of a milihartree (per electron) in accuracy by switching to a metaGGA or a properly tuned GGA.

for most functionals good energetics correspond to poor pressure determination.

much better description of hydrogen helium interactions can be attained by using the TPSS metaGGA, the BLYP GGA, or the nonlocal vdW-DF functionals.

(but is TPSS's large pressure errors a problem for using this to buile an EOS?)

(It's H errors also seem to change a lot with density)},

abstract = {The timescales and mechanisms for the formation and chemical differentiation of the planets can be quantified using the radioactive decay of short-lived isotopes. Of these, the (182)Hf-to-(182)W decay is ideally suited for dating core formation in planetary bodies. In an earlier study, the W isotope composition of the Earth's mantle was used to infer that core formation was late (> or = 60 million years after the beginning of the Solar System) and that accretion was a protracted process. The correct interpretation of Hf-W data depends, however, on accurate knowledge of the initial abundance of (182)Hf in the Solar System and the W isotope composition of chondritic meteorites. Here we report Hf-W data for carbonaceous and H chondrite meteorites that lead to timescales of accretion and core formation significantly different from those calculated previously. The revised ages for Vesta, Mars and Earth indicate rapid accretion, and show that the timescale for core formation decreases with decreasing size of the planet. We conclude that core formation in the terrestrial planets and the formation of the Moon must have occurred during the first approximately 30 million years of the life of the Solar System.},

@article{Cameron1991,
abstract = {In previous papers in this series the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method (SPH) has been used to explore the conditions in which a major planetary collision may have been responsible for the formation of the Moon. In Paper II (W. Benz, W.L. Slattery, and A.G.W. Cameron 1987, Icarus 71, 30-45) it was found that the optimum conditions were obtained when the mass ratio of the impactor to the protoearth was 0.136. In the present paper we investigate the importance of the equation of state by running this optimum case several times and varying the equation of state and other related parameters. The two equations of state compared are the Tillotson (used in the previous papers) and the CHART D/CSQ ANEOS. Because of differences in these equations of state, including the fact that different types of rocks were used in association with each, it was not possible to prepare initial planetary models that were comparable in every respect, so several different simulations were necessary in which different planetary parameters were matched between the equations of state. We also used a new version of the SPH code. The results reaffirmed the previous principal conclusions: the collisions produced a disk of rocky material in orbit, with most of the material derived from the impacting object. These results indicate that the equation of state is not a critical factor in determining the amount of material thrown into orbit. This confirms the conclusions of Paper II that gravitational torques, and not pressure gradients, inject the orbiting mass. However, the way this mass is distributed in orbit is affected by the equation of state and the choice of rock material, the Tillotson equation for granite giving slightly larger mean orbital radius for the particles left in orbit than the ANEOS dunite for the same impact parameter. We also find, compared to Paper II, that in all subsequent cases the new SPH code leads to a slightly less extended prelunar accretion disk. We think this is due to the new shape adopted for the kernel. A few additional calculations were made to test the effects of increasing the impact parameter on the calculations, other parameters remaining unchanged. The motivation for this was that solar tides will have reduced the Earth-Moon angular momentum somewhat over the course of time. An increment of 6% in the angular momentum of the collision increases the amount of iron-free material in orbit and its mean orbital radius, but more than that leaves increasing amounts of iron in orbit (the iron has a small mean orbital radius). The debris from the destroyed impacting object tends to form a straight rotating bar which is very effective in transferring angular momentum. If the material near the end of the bar extends well beyond the Roche lobe, it may become unstable against gravitational clumping.},

abstract = {Recent analyses of data from the NASA Kepler spacecraft have established that planets with radii within 25 per cent of the Earth's (R Earth symbol) are commonplace throughout the Galaxy, orbiting at least 16.5 per cent of Sun-like stars. Because these studies were sensitive to the sizes of the planets but not their masses, the question remains whether these Earth-sized planets are indeed similar to the Earth in bulk composition. The smallest planets for which masses have been accurately determined are Kepler-10b (1.42 R Earth symbol) and Kepler-36b (1.49 R Earth symbol), which are both significantly larger than the Earth. Recently, the planet Kepler-78b was discovered and found to have a radius of only 1.16 R Earth symbol. Here we report that the mass of this planet is 1.86 Earth masses. The resulting mean density of the planet is 5.57 g cm(-3), which is similar to that of the Earth and implies a composition of iron and rock.},

abstract = {The melting curves of two compositions of (Mg,Fe) SiO3-perovskite, the likely dominant mineral phase in the lower mantle, have been measured in a C02 laser-heated diamond cell with direct temperature measurements and in situ detection of melting. At 625 kilobars, the melting temperature is 5000 ± 200 kelvin, independent of composition. Extrapolation to the core-mantle boundary pressure of 1.35 megabar with three different melting relations yields melting temperatures between 7000 and 8500 kelvin. Thus, the temperature at the base of the lower mantle, accepted to lie between 2550 and 2750 kelvin, is only at about one-third of the melting temperature. The large difference between mantle temperature and corresponding melting temperature has several important implications; particularly the temperature sensitivity of the viscosity is reduced thus allowing large lateral temperature variations inferred from seismic tomographic velocity anomalies and systematics found in measured velocity-density functions. Extensive melting of the lower mantle can be ruled out throughout the history of the Earth.},

abstract = {Phase transitions and the chemical composition of minerals in Earth's interior influence geophysical interpretations of its deep structure and dynamics. A pressure-induced spin transition in olivine has been suggested to influence iron partitioning and depletion, resulting in a distinct layered structure in Earth's lower mantle. For a more realistic mantle composition (pyrolite), we observed a considerable change in the iron-magnesium partition coefficient at about 40 gigapascals that is explained by a spin transition at much lower pressures. However, only a small depletion of iron is observed in the major high-pressure phase (magnesium silicate perovskite), which may be explained by preferential retention of the iron ion Fe3+. Changes in mineral proportions or density are not associated with the change in partition coefficient. The observed density profile agrees well with seismological models, which suggests that pyrolite is a good model composition for the upper to middle parts of the lower mantle.},

Many of these planetesimals had metallic iron cores and during growth of the Earth this metal re-equilibrated with the Earth's silicate mantle, extracting siderophile ('iron-loving') elements into the Earth's iron-rich core. The current composition of the mantle indicates that much of the re-equilibration took place in a deep (> 400 km) molten silicate layer, or 'magma ocean', and that conditions became more oxidizing with time as the Earth grew. The high-pressure nature of the core-forming process led to the Earth's core being richer in low-atomic-number elements, notably silicon and possibly oxygen, than the cores of the smaller planetesimal building blocks.},

@article{Mukhopadhyay2012,
abstract = {The isotopes (129)Xe, produced from the radioactive decay of extinct (129)I, and (136)Xe, produced from extinct (244)Pu and extant (238)U, have provided important constraints on early mantle outgassing and volatile loss from Earth. The low ratios of radiogenic to non-radiogenic xenon ((129)Xe/(130)Xe) in ocean island basalts (OIBs) compared with mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs) have been used as evidence for the existence of a relatively undegassed primitive deep-mantle reservoir. However, the low (129)Xe/(130)Xe ratios in OIBs have also been attributed to mixing between subducted atmospheric Xe and MORB Xe, which obviates the need for a less degassed deep-mantle reservoir. Here I present new noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Xe) measurements from an Icelandic OIB that reveal differences in elemental abundances and (20)Ne/(22)Ne ratios between the Iceland mantle plume and the MORB source. These observations show that the lower (129)Xe/(130)Xe ratios in OIBs are due to a lower I/Xe ratio in the OIB mantle source and cannot be explained solely by mixing atmospheric Xe with MORB-type Xe. Because (129)I became extinct about 100 million years after the formation of the Solar System, OIB and MORB mantle sources must have differentiated by 4.45 billion years ago and subsequent mixing must have been limited. The Iceland plume source also has a higher proportion of Pu- to U-derived fission Xe, requiring the plume source to be less degassed than MORBs, a conclusion that is independent of noble gas concentrations and the partitioning behaviour of the noble gases with respect to their radiogenic parents. Overall, these results show that Earth's mantle accreted volatiles from at least two separate sources and that neither the Moon-forming impact nor 4.45 billion years of mantle convection has erased the signature of Earth's heterogeneous accretion and early differentiation.},

@article{Leconte2012,
abstract = {While conventional interior models for Jupiter and Saturn are based on the simplistic assumption of a solid core surrounded by a homogeneous gaseous envelope, we have derived new models with an inhomogeneous distribution of heavy elements within these planets. Such a compositional gradient hampers large-scale convection that turns into double-diffusive convection, yielding an inner thermal profile that departs from the traditionally assumed adiabatic interior and affecting these planets heat content and cooling history. To address this problem, we have developed an analytical approach to describe layered double-diffusive convection and apply this formalism to solar system gaseous giant planet interiors. These models satisfy all observational constraints and yield values for the metal enrichment of our gaseous giants that are up to 30% to 60% higher than previously thought. The models also constrain the size of the convective layers within the planets. Because the heavy elements tend to be redistributed within the gaseous envelope, the models predict smaller than usual central cores inside Saturn and Jupiter, with possibly no core for the latter. These models open a new window and raise new challenges to our understanding of the internal structure of giant (solar and extrasolar) planets, in particular on how to determine their heavy material content, a key diagnostic for planet formation theories.},

abstract = {In situ x-ray diffraction measurements of MgSiO3 were performed at high pressure and temperature similar to the conditions at Earth's core-mantle boundary. Results demonstrate that MgSiO3 perovskite transforms to a new high-pressure form with stacked SiO6-octahedral sheet structure above 125 gigapascals and 2500 kelvin (2700-kilometer depth near the base of the mantle) with an increase in density of 1.0 to 1.2%. The origin of the D" seismic discontinuity may be attributed to this post-perovskite phase transition. The new phase may have large elastic anisotropy and develop preferred orientation with platy crystal shape in the shear flow that can cause strong seismic anisotropy below the D" discontinuity.},

The habitable zone is the region where planetary temperatures are suitable for water to exist on a planet's surface. During the first 6 weeks of observations, Kepler monitored 156,000 stars, and five new exoplanets with sizes between 0.37 and 1.6 Jupiter radii and orbital periods from 3.2 to 4.9 days were discovered. The density of the Neptune-sized Kepler-4b is similar to that of Neptune and GJ 436b, even though the irradiation level is 800,000 times higher.

abstract = {We present new equations of state (EOS) for hydrogen and helium, intended for applications to low-mass stars (M < 1 Msun), brown dwarfs, and giant planets. They cover the range 2.10 <log T(K) < 7.06 and 4 <log P (dyn cm-2) < 19 and include new physical treatments of partial dissociation and ionization caused by both pressure and temperature effects. The hydrogen EOS is based on a careful study of nonideal interactions. In the case of helium, the principal features of the EOS physics are retained in a simplified model. The calculation is based on the free energy,minimization method, and a detailed account of the physical model has been published elsewhere. Mixtures of hydrogen and helium are obtained with the additive volume rule and an additional ideal entropy-of-mixing term. In this paper, we present extensive tabular results for both the H and He EOS, together with a critical analysis. Part of this analysis is based on a comparison with other EOS commonly used in astrophysics. Both EOS everywhere satisfy the requirements of thermal and mechanical stability and are thermodynamically consistent over most of the phase diagram. A complete set of the tables is available in the AAS CD-ROM Series, Vol. 5, and by anonymous FTP.},

However, simulations of the current giant impact hypothesis for Moon formation find that most lunar material originated from the impactor, which should have had a different isotopic signature. Previous Moon-formation studies assumed that the angular momentum after the impact was similar to the present day; however, Earth-mass planets are expected to have higher spin rates at the end of accretion. Here, we show that typical last giant impacts onto a fast-spinning proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming disk derived primarily from Earth's mantle. Furthermore, we find that a faster-spinning early Earth-Moon system can lose angular momentum and reach the present state through an orbital resonance between the Sun and Moon.},

Prior impact simulations predict that much of the disk material originates from the impacting planet. However, the Earth and Moon have essentially identical oxygen isotope compositions. This has been a challenge for the impact theory, because the impactor's composition would have likely differed from that of the Earth. Here, we simulate impacts involving larger impactors than previously considered. We show that these can produce a disk with the same composition as the planet's mantle, consistent with Earth-Moon compositional similarities. Such impacts require subsequent removal of angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system through a resonance with the Sun, as recently proposed.},

@article{Wood2005,
abstract = {Kelvin calculated the age of the Earth to be about 24 million years by assuming conductive cooling from being fully molten to its current state. Although simplistic, his result is interesting in the context of the dramatic cooling that took place after the putative Moon-forming giant impact, which contributed the final approximately 10 per cent of the Earth's mass. The rate of accretion and core segregation on Earth as deduced from the U-Pb system is much slower than that obtained from Hf-W systematics, and implies substantial accretion after the Moon-forming impact, which occurred 45 +/- 5 Myr after the beginning of the Solar System. Here we propose an explanation for the two timescales. We suggest that the Hf-W timescale reflects the principal phase of core-formation before the giant impact. Crystallization of silicate perovskite in the lower mantle during this phase produced Fe(3+), which was released during the giant impact, and this oxidation resulted in late segregation of sulphur-rich metal into which Pb dissolved readily, setting the younger U-Pb age of the Earth. Separation of the latter metal then occurred 30 +/- 10 Myr after the Moon-forming impact. Over this time span, in surprising agreement with Kelvin's result, the Earth cooled by about 4,000 K in returning from a fully molten to a partially crystalline state.},

The resulting equation of state (EOS) implies that Jupiter possesses a central core of 14-18 Earth masses of heavier elements, a result that supports core accretion as the standard model for the formation of hydrogen-rich giant planets. Our nominal model has about 4 Earth masses of planetary ices in the H-He-rich mantle, a result that is, within a modeling uncertainty of 6 Earth masses, consistent with abundances measured by the 1995 Galileo entry probe mission, suggesting that the composition found by the probe may be representative of the entire planet. Interior models derived from this first-principles EOS do not give a match to Jupiter's gravity moment J4 unless one invokes interior differential rotation, implying that Jovian interior dynamics has an observable effect on the high-order gravity field.},

abstract = {The oxygen fugacity f(O2)of the Earth's mantle is one of the fundamental variables in mantle petrology. Through ferric-ferrous iron and carbon-hydrogen-oxygen equilibria, f(O2) influences the pressure-temperature positions of mantle solidi and compositions of small-degree mantle melts. Among other parameters, f(O2) affects the water storage capacity and rheology of the mantle. The uppermost mantle, as represented by samples and partial melts, is sufficiently oxidized to sustain volatiles, such as H2O and CO2, as well as carbonatitic melts, but it is not known whether the shallow mantle is representative of the entire upper mantle. Using high-pressure experiments, we show here that large parts of the asthenosphere are likely to be metal-saturated. We found that pyroxene and garnet synthesized at >7 GPa in equilibrium with metallic Fe can incorporate sufficient ferric iron that the mantle at >250 km depth is so reduced that an (Fe,Ni)-metal phase may be stable. Our results indicate that the oxidized nature of the upper mantle can no longer be regarded as being representative for the Earth's upper mantle as a whole and instead that oxidation is a shallow phenomenon restricted to an upper veneer only about 250 km in thickness.},

Data from experiments performed on iron-sulfur and iron-nickel-sulfur systems at pressures corresponding to the center of Mars indicate that its core is presently completely liquid and that it will not form an outwardly crystallizing iron-rich inner core, as does Earth. Instead, planetary cooling will lead to core crystallization following either a "snowing-core" model, whereby iron-rich solids nucleate in the outer portions of the core and sink toward the center, or a "sulfide inner-core" model, where an iron-sulfide phase crystallizes to form a solid inner core.},

@article{Christensen2006,
abstract = {Mercury has a global magnetic field of internal origin and it is thought that a dynamo operating in the fluid part of Mercury's large iron core is the most probable cause. However, the low intensity of Mercury's magnetic field--about 1% the strength of the Earth's field--cannot be reconciled with an Earth-like dynamo. With the common assumption that Coriolis and Lorentz forces balance in planetary dynamos, a field thirty times stronger is expected. Here I present a numerical model of a dynamo driven by thermo-compositional convection associated with inner core solidification. The thermal gradient at the core-mantle boundary is subadiabatic, and hence the outer region of the liquid core is stably stratified with the dynamo operating only at depth, where a strong field is generated. Because of the planet's slow rotation the resulting magnetic field is dominated by small-scale components that fluctuate rapidly with time. The dynamo field diffuses through the stable conducting region, where rapidly varying parts are strongly attenuated by the skin effect, while the slowly varying dipole and quadrupole components pass to some degree. The model explains the observed structure and strength of Mercury's surface magnetic field and makes predictions that are testable with space missions both presently flying and planned.},

The low-degree gravity field, combined with planetary spin parameters, yields the moment of inertia C/MR(2) = 0.353 ± 0.017, where M and R are Mercury's mass and radius, and a ratio of the moment of inertia of Mercury's solid outer shell to that of the planet of C(m)/C = 0.452 ± 0.035. A model for Mercury's radial density distribution consistent with these results includes a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid Fe-S layer and an Fe-rich liquid outer core and perhaps a solid inner core.},

abstract = {The observed weakness of Mercury's magnetic field poses a long-standing puzzle to dynamo theory. Using numerical dynamo simulations, we show that it could be explained by a negative feedback between the magnetospheric and the internal magnetic fields. Without feedback, a small internal field was amplified by the dynamo process up to Earth-like values. With feedback, the field strength saturated at a much lower level, compatible with the observations at Mercury. The classical saturation mechanism via the Lorentz force was replaced by the external field impact. The resulting surface field was dominated by uneven harmonic components. This will allow the feedback model to be distinguished from other models once a more accurate field model is constructed from MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) and BepiColombo data.},

We determine the equation of state as a function of density, temperature, and composition and, using thermodynamic integration, we estimate the Gibbs free energy of mixing, thereby determining the temperature, at a given pressure, when helium becomes insoluble in dense metallic hydrogen. These results are directly relevant to models of the interior structure and evolution of Jovian planets. We find that the temperatures for the demixing of helium and hydrogen are sufficiently high to cross the planetary adiabat of Saturn at pressures approximately 5 Mbar; helium is partially miscible throughout a significant portion of the interior of Saturn, and to a lesser extent in Jupiter.},

abstract = {A novel least-squares fitting approach is presented to obtain classical force fields from trajectory and force databases produced by ab initio (e.g., Car-Parrinello) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The method was applied to derive effective nonpolarizable three-site force fields for liquid water at ambient conditions from Car-Parrinello MD simulations in the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr approximation to the electronic density functional theory. The force-matching procedure includes a fit of short-ranged nonbonded forces, bonded forces, and atomic partial charges. The various parameterizations of the water force field differ by an enforced smooth cut-off applied to the short-ranged interaction term. These were obtained by fitting to the trajectory and force data produced by Car-Parrinello MD simulations of systems of 32 and 64 H(2)O molecules. The new water force fields were developed assuming both flexible or rigid molecular geometry. The simulated structural and self-diffusion properties of liquid water using the fitted force fields are in close agreement with those observed in the underlying Car-Parrinello MD simulations. The resulting empirical models compare to experiment much better than many conventional simple point charge (SPC) models. The fitted potential is also shown to combine well with more sophisticated intramolecular potentials. Importantly, the computational cost of the new models is comparable to that for SPC-like potentials.},

The bcc phase also becomes more stable than the hcp above 35 TPa. The bct and bcc phases become considerably more stable than hcp and fcc at even higher pressures, and we expect this result to hold at high temperatures.},

abstract = {The distribution of geochemical species in the Earth's interior is largely controlled by fractional melting and crystallization processes that are intimately linked to the thermal state and evolution of the mantle. The existence of patches of dense partial melt at the base of the Earth's mantle, together with estimates of melting temperatures for deep mantle phases and the amount of cooling of the underlying core required to maintain a geodynamo throughout much of the Earth's history, suggest that more extensive deep melting occurred in the past. Here we show that a stable layer of dense melt formed at the base of the mantle early in the Earth's history would have undergone slow fractional crystallization, and would be an ideal candidate for an unsampled geochemical reservoir hosting a variety of incompatible species (most notably the missing budget of heat-producing elements) for an initial basal magma ocean thickness of about 1,000 km. Differences in 142Nd/144Nd ratios between chondrites and terrestrial rocks can be explained by fractional crystallization with a decay timescale of the order of 1 Gyr. These combined constraints yield thermal evolution models in which radiogenic heat production and latent heat exchange prevent early cooling of the core and possibly delay the onset of the geodynamo to 3.4-4 Gyr ago.},

However, the total amount of heavy elements that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune contain remains poorly constrained. The discovery of extrasolar giant planets with masses ranging from that of Saturn to a few times the mass of Jupiter opens up new possibilities for understanding planet composition and formation.

@article{Alfe2000,
abstract = {Knowledge of the composition of the Earth's core is important for understanding its melting point and therefore the temperature at the inner-core boundary and the temperature profile of the core and mantle. In addition, the partitioning of light elements between solid and liquid, as the outer core freezes at the inner-core boundary, is believed to drive compositional convection, which in turn generates the Earth's magnetic field. It is generally accepted that the liquid outer core and the solid inner core consist mainly of iron. The outer core, however, is also thought to contain a significant fraction of light elements, because its density--as deduced from seismological data and other measurements--is 6-10 per cent less than that estimated for pure liquid iron. Similar evidence indicates a smaller but still appreciable fraction of light elements in the inner core. The leading candidates for the light elements present in the core are sulphur, oxygen and silicon. Here we obtain a constraint on core composition derived from ab initio calculation of the chemical potentials of light elements dissolved in solid and liquid iron. We present results for the case of sulphur, which provide strong evidence against the proposal that the outer core is close to being a binary iron-sulphur mixture.},

Method Notes:

We start from the basic defnition that mX (per atom) can either represent the change of Gibbs free energy when an atom of X is added to the system at constant temperature T and pressure P, or the change of Helmholtz free energy F at constant T and volume V

In crystal: 
Calculate mu as from change in helmholtz free energy with a subsititutional x impurity, using the harmonic approximation to get entropy (F = E - TS) [cites Alfe 2000]

Use implementation of the small-displacement method to count vibrational frequencies [Kresse 2000]

To calculate away from the dilute limit invoke statistical mechanics of rearrangement of X atoms is equivalent to lattice-gas problem (use standard monte carlo methods) -> important DFT input is the free energy change between two atoms being far away and in neighboring sites.

In liquid: 
Use thermodynamic integration to find difference in F between two total energy functions (one corresponds to N Fe atoms and the other with N-1 Fe atoms) -> corresponds to a transmution. (Is there another paper where they explain this in greater depth?)

demands an unusual kind of simulation: for the atom positions r1,1⁄4rN at each instant of time, we have to perform two independent ab initio calculations, one for each chemical composition. As well as U0 and U1 for the given positions, we calculate two sets of ab initio forces. In practice, the statistical accuracy is rather poor if one `transmutes' only a single Fe atom into X, and it is preferable to `transmute' several atoms at the same time.},

abstract = {The Galileo probe showed that Jupiter's atmosphere is severely depleted in neon compared to protosolar values. We show via ab initio simulations of the partitioning of neon between hydrogen-helium phases that the observed depletion can be explained by the sequestration of neon into helium-rich droplets within the postulated hydrogen-helium immiscibility layer of the planets interior. We also demonstrate that this mechanism will not affect argon explaining the observed lack of depletion of this gas. This provides strong indirect evidence for hydrogen-helium immiscibility in Jupiter.},
